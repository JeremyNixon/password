Making itself intelligible is suicide for philosophy. 
Tell me how you read and I'll tell you who you are. 
Why is love beyond all measure of other human possibilities so rich and such a sweet burden for the one who has been struck by it? Because we change ourselves into that which we love, and yet remain ourselves. Then we would like to thank the beloved, but find nothing that would do it adequately. We can only be thankful to ourselves. Love transforms gratitude into faithfulness to ourselves and into an unconditional faith in the Other. Thus love steadily expands its most intimate secret. Closeness here is existence in the greatest distance from the other- the distance that allows nothing to dissolve - but rather presents the thou in the transparent, but incomprehensible revelation of the just there. That the presence of the other breaks into our own life - this is what no feeling can fully encompass. Human fate gives itself to human fate, and it is the task of pure love to keep this self-surrender as vital as on the first day. 
If I take death into my life, acknowledge it, and face it squarely, I will free myself from the anxiety of death and the pettiness of life - and only then will I be free to become myself.  
Every man is born as many men and dies as a single one.  
Anyone can achieve their fullest potential, who we are might be predetermined, but the path we follow is always of our own choosing. We should never allow our fears or the expectations of others to set the frontiers of our destiny. Your destiny can't be changed but, it can be challenged. Every man is born as many men and dies as a single one. 
Man acts as though he were the shaper and master of language, while in fact language remains the master of man.  
Why are there beings at all, instead of Nothing? 
The most thought-provoking thing in our thought-provoking time is that we are still not thinking. 
Thinking only begins at the point where we have come to know that Reason, glorified for centuries, is the most obstinate adversary of thinking.
The small are always dependent on the great; they are "small" precisely because they think they are independent. The great thinker is one who can hear what is greatest in the work of other "greats" and who can transform it in an original manner. 
Everyone is the other and no one is himself. 
The possible ranks higher than the actual. 
To think is to confine yourself to a single thought that one day stands still like a star in the world's sky. 
Longing is the agony of the nearness of the distant. 
truth is that which makes a people certain, clear, and strong.
